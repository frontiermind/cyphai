                  <h4 class="title-blue"><span>Description</span></h3>
                  <p>We are seeking 2+ postdoc researchers and 4+ Ph.D. candidates who collaborate with us in the project "CyPhAI: Formal Analysis and Design of AI-intensive Cyber-Physical Systems" funded by JST.  This project aims at establishing mathematically-solid methodologies to model, verify, test, monitor, and control a cyber-physical system in which AI plays crucial role (AI-CPS).  Successful candidates will work with Kohei Suenaga (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) or Masako Kishida (National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan) on this project.  The contract will initially run until the end of March 2021, with the possibility of annual renewal at maximum 5 years.</p>

                    <p>The main research topic of Suenaga's team will be learning for AI-CPS and verification of AI-CPS.  The expected research topic includes (but is not limited to) the following: (1) application of machine learning to synthesize the design of AI-CPS, (2) efficient machine learning for AI components in AI-CPS, and (3) (quantitative/statistical) model checking for AI-CPS.</p>
                    
                    <p>The main research topic of Kishida's team will be the control theory and method for AI-CPS.  The expected research topic includes (but is not limited to) the following: (1) application of machine learning for designing a controller and (2) control for machine-learned components.</p>

                    <p class="mb5"><strong>Postdoc researchers (Closed)</strong></p>
                    <p>You will pursue your research agenda in line with the project’s goal of applying formal methods to manufacturing. You need a Ph.D. degree (or to be close to completion) and a proven publication record. The experience of active interdisciplinary collaboration is highly desirable. The annual gross salary is determined according to the rules of the hiring instiution based on your qualifications. Insurances are covered according to the rules of the hiring institutions.</p>
                    <p class="mb5"><strong>Research Assistants (Ph.D. Students)</strong></p>
                    <p>We also invite students who will pursue their Ph.D. degrees under the supervision of Kohei or Masako. We may be able to cover your tuition and living expenses, although it’s been the norm for Ph.D. students in Japan to cover these expenses by themselves; the salary will be as competitive as that of JSPS Research fellowships. You need to pass the entrance examination conducted by the institution that your prospective supervisor belongs to.<br><br>
